Test MUX_TLS MUX_TCP_AES
=========
configure device
end of device configuration
testing tls and tcp aes mux
upload xml in file system
tls accept xml uploaded
ftp closed
print xml import successfully and telnet was closed accept tls
uploading eds4100 accept mode settings:
xml import successfully and telnet was closed accept tls
Configuring xpico240
xpico240:uploading tls certificates
tls xml imported successfully
xpico240 ready to send tls commands:
reboot device
test mux tls
connect and accept mux commands tests begin
serial opened
test case 1: mux receive
connect to remote host
accept mux commands test started
verify connection
checking data K received or not
out value: 0
connection established. received K
serial opened
test case 2: send and push Hex data
initiate hex data send
1
out1 value: 0
hex data send initiated
send data
out2 value: 0
data sent
push data from mux and verify remote host receives data
out3 value: 0
data received
test case: hex data send passed
test case 3: read binary data
binary data read initiated
got data from EDS4100
test case: binary data receive passed
test case 4: send binary data
binary data send initiated
data sent
push the data
pushed the data
test case 5: end the connection
connection ended
test case: send binary passed
hexsend_result is 1
sendbinary_result is 1
readbinary_result is 1
tcp aes result checking::::: 1
mux tls result is 1
MUX TEST CASE PASSED
